# Recycle-Rush-Robot-Code-Omni
Team 3926's code for Recycle Rush 2015 omni wheel drive
Modified by Little.G.Ban



This specific modification has not been tested and treat it as such.
This modification gives more Autonomous Functions.

The Added functions are:
Strafe (to move sideways)
Lift (to lift the arm)

Additionally another parameter has been added for Strafe, Lift, Turn, and Drive. Now the speed can be controlled in a parameter! 
However if no speed parameter is present it should set the speed to the default -> 0.5.

Later addons to this will probably include:

A function for waiting and initializing speed to shorten the code.

And potentially:
A move distance function which instead of setting the speed and time you will be able to set the distance and speed.

Enjoy!
